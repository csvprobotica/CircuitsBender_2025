* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition


## Introduction

_The project consists of building and programming a robot using LEGO EV3, designed to navigate a challenge course. This robot combines LEGO mechanical and electronic components with electronic controllers and sensors, allowing us to explore the fundamental concepts of engineering and programming._
