This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2024.

## Content

* [`schemes`](https://github.com/new) contains a schematic diagram in PNG format of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they are connected to each other.
* [`src`]() contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition.
* [`t-photos`]() contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members).
* [`v-photos`]() contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom).
* [`video`]() contains the video.mp4 file with the robot driving demonstration.

## Introduction

_The RoSGhost team is integrated by Nahomy Sclopis, Alex Gonzalez and Alexis Quintero, who represent Colegio San Vicente de Pa√∫l in this Future Engineers competition. The project consists of building and programming a robot using LEGO Inventor, designed to navigate a challenge course. This robot combines LEGO mechanical and electronic components with electronic controllers and sensors, allowing us to explore the fundamental concepts of engineering and programming._

## Mision
_Participating in the Future Engineers Competition for the first time is an exciting and enriching experience. We hope to learn deeply about the integration of mechanics and programming through the construction of our LEGO robot._

## Vision
_Beyond the competition, we are excited to tackle innovative challenges, interact with other teams passionate about engineering, and see our ideas take shape on the competition track._

## Challenges
_This challenge will allow us to apply theoretical concepts in a hands-on environment, develop critical problem-solving skills, and collaborate effectively as a team._

_The robot we will use for this challenge contains the following electronic components._

1. Clone this repo by using the `git clone` functionality.
2. Remove `.git` directory
3. [Initialize a new public repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new) by following instructions from "create a new repository on the command line" section (appeared after pressing "Create repository" button).
