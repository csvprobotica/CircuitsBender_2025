This directory contains the main source code made in the Lego Inventor MINDSTORMS program, the code is based on [`blocks`](https://github.com/csvprobotica/RoSGhost/blob/main/src/RoSGhost.lms) and also in [`python code`](https://github.com/csvprobotica/RoSGhost/blob/main/src/runRoSGhost.py).

All the programming has been done by ourselves.
