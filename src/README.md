Control software

This directory contains the main source code made in the Lego Inventor MINDSTORMS program, the code is based on [blocks](https://github.com/csvprobotica/RoSGhost/blob/main/src/RoSGhost.lms) and also in [python code](https://github.com/csvprobotica/RoSGhost/blob/main/src/runRoSGhost.py).

All the programming has been done by ourselves.
