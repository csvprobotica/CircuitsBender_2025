## Models
This directory contains the 3D modeling files for the construction of our robot.  To run the 3D modeling files requires the [`Studio 2.0`](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) application, which allows us to build, render and create instructions.

## 3D Model
This is the design we created ourselves with the Studio 2.0 application.
