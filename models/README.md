## Models
This directory contains the 3D modeling files for the construction of our robot.  To run the 3D modeling files requires the [`Studio 2.0`](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) application, which allows us to build, render and create instructions.

For this robot design, the following library was used as reference for the construction in the Studio 2.0 application, which contains the elements for the LEGO Spike and Inventor version. [`Custom Parts`](https://github.com/csvprobotica/RoSGhost/blob/main/models/CustomParts.rar)
